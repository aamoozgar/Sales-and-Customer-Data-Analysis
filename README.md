# Sales and Customer Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of sales and customer behavior to support strategic decision-making. The primary goal was to identify growth opportunities, optimize sales strategies, and provide actionable insights for a sales management team.

---

## Problem Statement

A sales manager needs a clear understanding of key performance indicators (KPIs) to improve overall business profitability. The analysis was initiated to answer critical questions such as:
- What are the primary drivers of sales and profit?
- Are current discount policies effective?
- Which regions and products offer the highest potential for growth?

---

## Data Source

The analysis was performed on a three-year sales and customer dataset, covering the period from 2014 to 2017. The dataset contains detailed information on orders, products, customers, and regional sales.

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL:** Used for data cleaning, transformation, and in-depth analysis of sales, profit, and customer data. Advanced queries with CTEs (Common Table Expressions) were used to identify key insights.
- **Power BI:** Utilized for building an interactive and visually compelling dashboard, allowing for an intuitive exploration of the data.
- **Markdown:** Used to structure and document the project in this professional README file.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed several critical insights:

- **Discount Policy Ineffectiveness:** A scatter plot showed a weak correlation between discounts and sales. A deeper analysis revealed a counter-intuitive finding: a higher average discount (13.5%) was applied to the top 10 most profitable products, while the bottom 10 least profitable products received a lower average discount (3.5%). This policy is leading to a loss of profit on successful items rather than driving sales for underperforming ones.
- **High-Potential Growth Areas:** The **West region** leads in both total sales and customer count, indicating a high-growth market.
- **Product Profitability:** The **Technology** product category proved to be the most profitable, contributing significantly to the company's bottom line.
- **Loyal Customers:** The top 10 customers collectively accounted for a significant portion of total revenue, highlighting the importance of customer loyalty programs.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Sales data shows a clear upward trend in the fall months, peaking in September and November, suggesting strategic opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

1.  **Revise the Discount Policy:** Reallocate the discount budget from top-performing products to underperforming ones, or invest the funds into more effective channels like marketing or customer loyalty programs.
2.  **Strategic Focus:** Develop a concentrated strategy to capitalize on the growth potential in the West region and the Technology product category.
3.  **Optimize Marketing Efforts:** Plan marketing and sales campaigns around the peak fall season to maximize revenue.
